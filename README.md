# Profiling-Gem5-Project

This repo contains our source codes and files for the Profiling gem5 project.
We are to simulate different workloads on the gem5 simulator and monitor their performance across various platforms.
The goal of this project is to recommend optimizations for the gem5 simulator without making many changes to the source code.
